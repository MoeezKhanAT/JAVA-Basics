## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## Setting up the Environment

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

## Basic Syntax

Start with the basic syntax of Java by creating a simple "Hello, World!" program.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Advanced Topics

Explore advanced topics like exception handling, file I/O, collections framework, and multithreading.
